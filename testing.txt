Socket, socket, what are you?
You are created for communication.
IPv4 or IPv6 - it doesn't matter,
You will connect us for sure.
socket.AF_INET
These two lines are the foundation,
Without them there will be no connection.
IPv4 is an address,
SOCK_STREAM is a protocol.
socket.SOCK_STREAM
Connect us, socket, please,
So that we can communicate.
